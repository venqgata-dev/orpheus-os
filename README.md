Orpheus OS

Open-Source AI Verification & Digital Sovereignty Infrastructure

Orpheus OS is an open-source AI verification and governance layer designed to enforce policy, audit behavior, and enable sovereign control over AI systems.

It is not a traditional operating system.

It is a lightweight infrastructure control layer that runs on top of Linux and containerized environments.

Vision

The future problem is not building AI.

The future problem is trusting AI.

Orpheus OS exists to:

Verify AI behavior

Enforce runtime policies

Provide immutable audit trails

Enable sovereign AI infrastructure

Support enterprise and national digital sovereignty

Core Principles

Open Source First

Cloud Agnostic

Model Agnostic

Lightweight by Design

Security by Default

Transparent & Auditable

What Orpheus OS Does

Orpheus acts as a verification layer between AI workloads and infrastructure.

It can:

Sandbox AI models in containers

Enforce runtime policies (network, data access, execution boundaries)

Log prompts and outputs securely

Hash and store immutable audit records

Operate in air-gapped environments

Scale across nodes

Architecture (v0.1 Concept)

Linux Host
→ Container Runtime (Docker / Podman)
→ Orpheus Agent
→ Policy Engine
→ Audit Logger

v0.1 Roadmap

Initial prototype includes:

Rust-based Orpheus Agent

YAML-based policy enforcement

Container workload monitoring

SQLite audit logging

CLI management interface

Long-Term Direction

Future versions aim to support:

Multi-node orchestration

Kubernetes integration

Enterprise dashboard

Cryptographic log verification

Sovereign infrastructure deployments

Why "Orpheus"?

Named after the mythological figure Orpheus — symbol of knowledge, creation, and descent into complexity — this project represents the effort to bring clarity, verification, and trust to AI systems.
